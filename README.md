## Prerequisites

**NOTE: You are expecting to have some (not necessarily to have many or a lot) basic experience with bash commands, and Python or R programming. We will use basic bash command lines, simple coding in Python and R in the course.** 

## Description

Scientific software is often dependent on other packages and libraries (and specific versions of these).  The dependencies are hard to reproduce upon redeployment by collaborators and users who may not share the same system setup.  This creates an unnecessary barrier to sharing many excellent software packages making them less shareable and reproducible.

Containers are an effective solution to this problem. The course teaches the fundamentals of creating, deploying and managing containers. You will learn about the essential commands and scripts, about Docker Hub and Singularity (HPC-friendly solution). The workshop will be delivered through a combination of slides, demonstrations and hands-on practice.

This course consists of 3 parts as follows.

- **Part 1**: Introducing containers, Docker command lines.
  - In this part, you will learn why containers are used, what containers are, and you will get hands-on practice with Docker (the most popular container tool) command lines.

- **Part 2**: Create containers with examples. 
  - In this part, you will get familiar with creating container images in Docker environment. You will learn to compose Dockerfile and build container images through examples including bash, Python and R. You will get hands-on practice as well.

- **Part 3**: Share container images and scale up with singularity.
  - In this part, you will practice how to share your own container images with others using either Docker Hub distribution or other ways. You will also learn how to run images using singularity on high performance computing cluster or cloud.

## On completion of this course you will be able to: 

- Understand the benefits of using containers for research 
- Use the Docker commands and basic Singularity commandsCompose Dockerfiles to build docker containers
- Manage Docker Hub repository
- Share Docker container images
- Interpret common errors and use these to help debug a container
- Use singularity to scale up containers on HPC
